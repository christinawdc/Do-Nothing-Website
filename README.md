# Do Nothing Website üéØ


## Basic Details

### Participation Type: Individual
- Christina George - St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai.

### Project Description
An entirely useless website that lets you click a button‚Ä¶ over and over, just to watch it do absolutely nothing. Perfect for anyone seeking a little bit of extra procrastination.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes, we just don‚Äôt have enough pointless things to do. How can we entertain ourselves with something that wastes time perfectly?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A website with a button that does absolutely nothing except replicate itself for no good reason. Plus, it rewards you with bizarre achievements and random quotes as you click, because why not?
