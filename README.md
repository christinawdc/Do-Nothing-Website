# Do Nothing Website ðŸŽ¯


## Basic Details

### Participation Type: Individual
- Christina George - St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai.

### Project Description
An entirely useless website that lets you click a buttonâ€¦ over and over, just to watch it do absolutely nothing. Perfect for anyone seeking a little bit of extra procrastination.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes, we just donâ€™t have enough pointless things to do. How can we entertain ourselves with something that wastes time perfectly?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A website with a button that does absolutely nothing except replicate itself for no good reason. Plus, it rewards you with bizarre achievements and random quotes as you click, because why not?

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
Software:
- Languages used : HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Frameworks used : None
- Libraries used : Canvas Confetti (for creating confetti animations).
- Tools used : VSCode Editor, Web Browser, ChatGPT

### Implementation
For Software Implementation:

Overview of Technologies and Tools

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the primary technologies. The Canvas Confetti library is used for celebratory effects upon reaching milestones. ChatGPT was used to generating code snippets for some features as well as for debugging assistance.


Project Structure

The single-page application is contained in an index.html file, where CSS and JavaScript are embedded within <style> and <script> tags, respectively. This keeps everything in one file for simplicity.

Key Features and Functions

Button Click Handling: The doNothingButton button increments a click counter on each press. After each click, it displays a random message from a predefined list.

Progress Bar: The progress bar dynamically updates its width based on the click count. CSS transitions make the bar fill smoothly.

# Installation
To get started with the Do Nothing Website, follow these commands:
- Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/christinawdc/Do-Nothing-Website.git

- Navigate into the project directory
cd Do-Nothing-Website



# Run
Run the website in a local server to begin your journey of doing absolutely nothing.
Start a local server (use live-server, http-server, or similar tools)
npx live-server
Or open index.html directly in your browser and prepare to achieve nothing.

Or just open this link in a new tab:

### Project Documentation
For Software:
This Do Nothing Website doesnâ€™t have any real functionality, but hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of how the project is structured:

HTML: Defines the layout of the single, unproductive button.
CSS: Adds a touch of color and style, making the button look just enticing enough to click.
JavaScript: Handles all interactive elementsâ€”the clicks, messages, animations, and duplicate button spawns.
